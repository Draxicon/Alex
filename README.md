## The Problem
I have a plant that needs minimum care, but
i still somehow forget to most of the time though.

## The Solution
I would like to have a way to monitor the moisture of the soil
and later on other factors to montior the plants health, and display
that info on a screen in the form of faces on an oled screen

## materials
1x Arduino nano
1x soil moisture sensor
1x 2in OLED display

## future additions
other sensors to monitor the plants healths
